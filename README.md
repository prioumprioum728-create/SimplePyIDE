SimplePyIDE

SimplePyIDE is a small Android app I am building on my tablet.

It is a Pydroid3-style Python IDE.
The app will let you:

- write Python code
- save files
- run Python
- view output in a terminal
- manage simple files (like contacts and call logs)

Files in this project

- "main.py" → test python program
- "system_incoming_call.csv" → fake call log database
- Android layout with code editor and terminal

Goal

My goal is to make a simple Python IDE that works on Android tablets without needing a PC.

Status
